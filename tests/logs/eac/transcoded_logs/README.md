# foreign_logs

This folder contains tests for the EAC translator module. Each of these logs were taken from
EAC (whether valid or otherwise), transcoded to UTF-8 (from whatever encoding they were in),
and then that is used for the tests. These logs should not be used for end-to-end testing of
the Logchecker system.
